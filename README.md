# EC2 Deployment 

## Getting Started

Create a `data.sh` file with right permission :
```
#!/bin/bash
export SERVER=<Your_Server_Addresse>
```
For user group, we can execute it and write on it. (Write is not necessary, but usefull if you are going to setup a lot of addresses without saving the file with sudo)
```
chmod ug+x+w data.sh
```

If you want to setup your EC2 instance easily, choose Ubuntu 18.04 server and execute first_deploy script :

first_deploy.sh : Change 

```
#This script is ug+w+x 
./first_deploy.sh
```
